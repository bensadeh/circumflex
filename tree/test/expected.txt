  [0m¼ There's a famous optical illusion ½ with a spinning silhouette of a dancer. When you ¾, look at it, you'll
  [0mswear it's spinning in one direction — say, counter-clockwise. In fact, you'll be so sure it's spinning
  [0mcounter-clockwise, that the idea it could be spinning in the opposite direction will seem impossible to you.
  [0mBut if you stare at it long enough, and intently enough, you can make it spin the other way.

  [0m
  [0mPeople on the left think that anyone on the right is a lunatic, and everyone on the right thinks the same

  [0mcoming from my side seems reasonable to me. In fact, it seems impossible that a reasonable person could think
  [0many other way. But since I grew up in a family that leaned in the opposite direction, and I shared their same
  [0mmindset in my younger days, I can now draw on that experience, and I can take a political tweet that everyone
  [0mon my side thinks is insane, and I can stare at it, and just as with the spinning dancer, I can flip it in my
  [0mhead so it seems reasonable.
  [0m

  [0mOne of the things this election, and the last four years, has shown me, is the impact of technology on our
  [0mpolitical discourse. It hasn't been a "good" insight.
  [0m
  [0mFederal Election records indicate that the leadership of technology companies overwhelmingly supported a set
  [0mof values that their employees appear to just as overwhelmingly reject. That dissonance is really quite
  [0mremarkable.
  [0m
  [0mI see one of the fundamental challenges facing the new administration is how to address this. I am not a fan
  [0mof government regulation, more of a "let the markets decide" kind of guy. I recognize however there is a
  [0msystemic risk where the technology "owner" can exploit it to harm society in a way that was previously
  [0mimpossible.
  [0m
  [0mWhile the country has focused on disinformation and hate speech, consider a company that controls, in real
  [0mtime, the self-driving software in a car. Such a technology, if weaponized, to could kill hundreds of
  [0mthousands of people. Or it could be weaponize to kill select people who were in the intersection of riding in
  [0ma self-driven car and in disfavor by the company that really controls that car.
  [0m
  [0mEarly on in my career I chose not to work for military contractors who were the "big" employers in Los Angeles
  [0mat the time I graduated from college. They were clearly engaged in finding clever, or at least more effective,
  [0mways to kill people and that wasn't where I wanted to spend my time. But what about someone working on self
  [0mdriving? It saves lives by avoiding some of the things end up resulting in crashes. But it also provides an
  [0mopportunity for great evil.
  [0m
  [0mDo we trust the person in charge to not be evil? Companies change and while they might declare their
  [0mintentions when they are growing, what happens when they are on top? Sometimes those quaint notions get cast
  [0maside when being a little bit evil makes what you're trying to do that much easier or maybe that much more
  [0mprofitable.
  [0m
  [0mWhat is the appropriate response, in a democracy, to a small number of people controlling a potential weapon
  [0mthat can destroy that democracy? Sadly this is no longer an idle question.

  [0mrhetoric and logical fallacies. Wish I was teaching a course right about now. Timely for the application of
  [0mmanure on fields too…
  [0m
  [0m7. It would be nice if the mods kept the discussion away from an r/politics-ization of HN. The sides are
  [0mpretty obvious and enforcing an arbitrary quota of half blue hurrah/half red hurrah would lead to a better

  [0mA voting system needs to be accurate but it also needs to inspire confidence. I think the U.S. failed on the

  [0m[3moutcome[0m.
  [0m
  [0mMail-in voting has existed for a long time, but it is being done at a larger scale and in new ways and new
  [0mplaces. It was a mistake to do it during such a contentious election. Covid is not a good enough reason: it's
  [0measy enough to drop the ballot in a county box so the secretary of state has a chain of custody for all valid
  [0mballots. I would actually prefer voter ID as well as people standing there to do a brief check. In addition to
  [0mpreventing fraud, it also helps remind voters if they forgot to sign or something.
  [0m
  [0mAlso, I think it needs to be said that a lot of people hate Trump. Hate can cause people to do things that
  [0mthey would never imagine doing otherwise, like election fraud. It doesn't need to be a conspiracy… just a lot
  [0mof individuals doing small stuff (post office employees throwing away likely Trump ballots, etc.).
  [0m
  [0mAnd it doesn't help that the map looked quite red on the day of the election, and that the poll numbers were
  [0mWAY off, and that the media was rooting for Biden. It all just erodes confidence.

  [0m[31m▎[0mIf you take the perspective of states as sovereign, with federation between them, then the Electoral College⁣

  [0m[31m▎[0mmuch as to represent the collection of people from all states - both concepts were critical. The idea is that⁣
  [0m[31m▎[0mpeople from the nation deserve representation [3mand[0m that each state (and the people from that state as a⁣
  [0m[31m▎[0msub-population) deserve representation.⁣
  [0m[31m▎[0m⁣
  [0m[31m▎[0mIf federation of states is a core concept of the subdivision of governing responsibility, then it makes sense⁣
  [0m[31m▎[0mto build a system that ensures each state has meaningful weight in the governance of that federation.⁣
  [0m[31m▎[0m⁣
  [0m[31m▎[0mNone of this is an argument for or against the Electoral College, nor should it be interpreted as arguing for⁣
  [0m[31m▎[0mthe correctness/effectiveness/righteousness/morality of the institution. It is simply an attempt to share⁣

  [0m[31m▎[0mAs originally defined, the House of Representatives was the only piece of the federal government intended to⁣

  [0m[31m▎[0mSenate was intended to represent the states, not the people directly.⁣
  [0m[31m▎[0m⁣
  [0m[31m▎[0mThe Electoral College was an intermediary to represent both the states and the people - as a compromise, it⁣
  [0m[31m▎[0mhas many failings that seem obvious today. There is no federal mandate as to how a state's electors choose to⁣
  [0m[31m▎[0mcast their votes. Each state is responsible for regulating its own voting - this includes how people vote⁣
  [0m[31m▎[0mand how electors are chosen and how those electors vote. It is mere happenstance that the majority of states⁣
  [0m[31m▎[0mhave a winner-takes-all allotment strategy for their electors. Maine and Nebraska notably assign their⁣
  [0m[31m▎[0melectors proportionally.⁣
  [0m[31m▎[0m⁣
  [0m[31m▎[0mIt is also interesting to note that the tie-breaking mechanism for an Electoral College tie devolves to the⁣
  [0m[31m▎[0mHouse, not with one vote per representative, but with one vote per state. This is another example of the⁣

  [0mAs a Canadian, what stands out for me about the last two elections is that many Americans seem to desperately
  [0mwant a variety of political reforms, but neither party seems interested in providing them. Trump and Sanders
  [0mboth sold themselves as reform candidates in 2016, but only Trump wound up on the ticket.
  [0m
  [0mSanders might be the real deal, but he's not going to represent a major party until donation and campaign
  [0mspending limits (like we have in Canada) reduce corporate influence on U.S. politics. Sanders scares away the
  [0m"big money" that U.S. elections depend so heavily on.
  [0m
  [0mTrump has not proven to be a reform candidate in any sense of the word. As a political outsider with control
  [0mover both the house and senate for his first two years in office, he had the power to deliver meaningful
  [0mreforms, but didn't. Americans desiring reform [3mshould[0m have felt deeply betrayed by Trump's first term.
  [0m
  [0mThe democrats had a smoother primary in 2020, but decided on an utterly bland candidate. Biden is a return to
  [0mthe status-quo. I predicted that, after the last four years, a return to the status quo would appeal to many,
  [0mbut this election proves otherwise. This [3mshould[0m have been an [3measy[0m slam dunk for the Democrats to win, but it's
  [0mturned out to be a squeaker!
  [0m
  [0mIf the democrats ride the status quo for the next four years and both parties were to run the same candidates
  [0magain, I suspect Biden would lose. The Democrats need to pay attention to what Americans want.
  [0m
  [0mI would suggest that Biden's administration should, despite running on a thoroughly status-quo platform,
  [0m[3membrace[0m reform. Too many Americans mistrust their own political system, to the point that they're willing to
  [0mpicket polling stations because they think fraud is being committed. That must be fixed. Finding ways to
  [0mreduce the influence of money on politics (e.g. campaign spending limits) would be a good start. It will also
  [0mbe an easy sell to devolve and distribute some of the powers that have accumulated in the white house over the
  [0mlast several decades. If you're not comfortable with some of the powers Trump wielded during his time in
  [0moffice, then perhaps those powers shouldn't rest with the POTUS.
  [0m
  [0mBottom line, if the democrats try to pretend Trump [3mnever[0m happened and [3mcouldn't[0m happen again, they're in for
  [0munpleasant surprises.

  [0mwell off as to never having been too poor to afford health insurance but just above the cut off to get free
  [0mhealth insurance. Families with kids and high living costs, and then being forced to pay over $2000 as penalty

  [0m
  [0mSimple as that, and certainly not as idealistic as these comments imply. Those who don't see that did not have

  [0mHere is a simplifying view: In the US there are some people, less than 1% of the voting population, who have a
  [0mlot of power and control of a lot of money and are looking to the political system to make more money.
  [0m
  [0mThis less than 1% do disagree among themselves, and that disagreement is the fundamental source of essentially
  [0mall the political fighting.
  [0m
  [0mFor the other 99+%, there isn't much to fight about.
  [0m
  [0mWhat the other 99+% want can be summarized in one word — [3mmore[0m. For more detail, they want the two biggies,
  [0mpeace and prosperity. For more, they want "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness", financial and
  [0memotional security, love, home and family, good health, happy, successful children. There's not a lot to fight
  [0mabout there.
  [0m
  [0mSo, again, the fighting is from the less than 1% who want to use their money and power to get more money.
  [0m
  [0mOf course, way more than 1% of the voting population are highly concerned about politics, are fighting, but,
  [0msorry, guys, they are foot soldiers, pawns, for the less than 1%.
  [0m
  [0mAs an example, let's take one of the issues, say, health care. Glancing at history, US health care has come a
  [0mlong way since the lone country doctor with a one horse carriage. In terms of current US medicine, he was not
  [0mvery good. Point: Health care has changed a lot and is still changing, rapidly. So, what solution we come up
  [0mwith should accommodate such change.
  [0m
  [0mHealth care can be really expensive, and we need a solution for that. We need in some sense to [3mlevel out[0m the
  [0mcosts, make them predictable. Ways have been private medical insurance, health care membership organizations,
  [0mand government provided health care.
  [0m
  [0mSo, here are the main concerns: Private health insurance is too expensive for a major fraction of the
  [0mpopulation, so those people look to other options. Then for the other options, concerns are quality of care
  [0m(it might be too cheap and not very good — loved ones could die), waiting times, and big tax increases. Point:
  [0mThese are all issues, but some examples can show that we should be able to do quite well on all the issues of
  [0mquality, waiting times, costs, etc., well enough that we should not have much to fight about.
  [0m
  [0mAnd there has been the issue of private insurance and "pre-existing" conditions. We can all agree that it
  [0mwould be nice for private insurance companies to ignore such data, conditions. And the richer US states did
  [0mhave laws forcing the insurance companies to so ignore. But maybe now the US is wealthy enough to so ignore
  [0mfor everyone. Hopefully. So, we can all agree or nearly so. Not much to fight about.
  [0m
  [0mSo, what is the cause of the the fighting? With some approaches and situations, for less than 1% of the voting
  [0mpopulation, there is or can be a lot of money involved, or a lot of power and then a lot of money.
  [0m
  [0mMy view is that we can go down the list of main political topics and conclude the same — for 99+% of the
  [0mvoters, there's not much to fight about except some people, less than 1%, want to fight to make money, big
  [0mmoney.
  [0m
  [0mBut for various policies, operations, programs, etc., it really is possible just to make a mess, to create
  [0mwaste. At least the 99+% can be against the waste!
  [0m
  [0mE.g., for the [36m$trilions[0m W and Obama spent on Gulf War II, was that from (a) people who were in line to make
  [0mmoney from the effort or (b) just waste? I'd say, some of (a) but mostly (b). Point: Not all the issues are
  [0mabout the less than 1% seeking money and, instead, there can also be ordinary waste.
  [0m
  [0mBottom line: The 99% should throttle the less than 1%, settle differences, and get on with life.

  [0mThe division and basically legal corruption are my concerns.
  [0m
  [0mOn a basic level, we are all people and all run the same basic way, and have the same basic needs.
  [0m
  [0mOne layer up, we are Americans. Those of us who travel, or who communicate outside the domestic US, see many
  [0mother nations and often a higher degree of solidarity as citizens.
  [0m
  [0mLooks like a priority problem to me.
  [0m
  [0mWe all need to earn enough to make it, or we all end up paying the costs associated with chronic homelessness,
  [0mfor example.
  [0m
  [0mWe all need to see the doctor too.
  [0m
  [0mEating good food, and the other human basics are not hard to understand.
  [0m
  [0mOften, I see "those other people" type arguments of various kinds too.
  [0m
  [0mLazy people. Different colored people. Weird people. Other people; namely, not people like us, or not in our
  [0mtribe, group, and…
  [0m
  [0mOrdinary people do not have very effective representation. Money talks. And it should, but that brings me back
  [0mto priorities again.
  [0m
  [0mNo judgement, no blame here. Just observations.
  [0m
  [0mI submit resolving these things to a more harmonious body politic is on us people. I am not convinced anyone,
  [0mor entity can just swoop in and improve things.
  [0m
  [0mThat is just where we are today.
  [0m
  [0mOne other observation:
  [0m
  [0mNations older than us have been where we are. Their peoples have had to do the work to get past it, and have
  [0mhad to do that multiple times.
  [0m
  [0mThis tells me we aren't experiencing anything fundementally new, in human terms.
  [0m
  [0mBut it is new to America. New in the sense of the USA being young enough, and the pace of change in the world
  [0mbeing rapid enough for the state of things to feel new, or like doom, or, or…
  [0m
  [0mGiven the burden of improving on our current state lies with us as people, citizens, I submit the following:
  [0m
  [0mWe all need to understand one another better. That starts by talking. Really talking and listening. This is
  [0mbest done sans judgement, and with deliberate intent to understand better.
  [0m
  [0mWe all are where we are in life, and we all have made choices, and relitigating the past does not appear to
  [0mhold answers for our future.
  [0m
  [0mThis is about what we do now. It is about our priorities as humans and Americans too.
  [0m
  [0mTake voting, for example.
  [0m
  [0mPeople had the following options:
  [0m
  [0mVote Major Party
  [0m
  [0mVote other
  [0m
  [0mNo vote.
  [0m
  [0mEveryone made their choice and had reasons, right?
  [0m
  [0mIf we apply the intent to seek understanding of one another and avoid judgement, that means having a talk
  [0mabout why people voted or no voted the way they did.
  [0m
  [0mPeople no voting, often did so because they did not want to consent to, or endorse, approve of what they see
  [0mas ineffective, corrupt governance. Or they did not connect a vote to a positive future for themselves and
  [0mtheirs.
  [0m
  [0mWhy is that? I think many, and include myself until recently, would rush to judge and blame.
  [0m
  [0mA vote for non major party X really is a vote for major party Y. Same for staying home.
  [0m
  [0mAfter talking some, the idea of candidates interviewing for a job comes up and poor or toxic representation
  [0mmeans not approving them for the job, and with that we see lazy, or stupid aren't really valid as reasons why.
  [0m
  [0mI will stop there, and urge you to think about how all of that is framed up as a duty, or burden and how
  [0mpeople may reject all of that in light of what they may see as an irrational election.
  [0m
  [0mSame goes for how people have voted or not before too. Those decisions are made, cannot be unmade and people
  [0mhad their reasons for making them.
  [0m
  [0mNotably, after some real discussion, the reality hits: we can't tell people to approve of potential leaders,
  [0mand we can't dictate what is best, nor their point of view.
  [0m
  [0mWe can talk to them and understand what they need to cast a vote. We can attract them to join a cause and all
  [0mthat too.
  [0m
  [0mSo why doesn't that happen more?
  [0m
  [0mI submit this is a big part of the priority and mutual understanding and consideration discussion we all need
  [0mto have.
  [0m
  [0mWithout that talk being a fundamental part of our body politic, we appear to be divided into factions, blocs
  [0mwho understand others, "those other people" increasingly poorly as pressure to avoid the worst continues to
  [0mrise.
  [0m
  [0mWith that discussion, it becomes much easier to see what we may consider an obvious, rational choice, say
  [0mlesser evil as an example, really is not so obvious, or may even be harmful, not a lesser evil, but perhaps
  [0mjust a different kind.
  [0m
  [0mNo matter how this all goes, at any given time our future is about the decisions we make together, the actions
  [0mwe take together, and the outcome we live with together.
  [0m
  [0mThe election is past us now, but please do consider it was about the votes people were about to cast, not the
  [0mones they may have cast in the past.
  [0m
  [0mTalking about all that is much easier and can be far more effective when people are not also fending off
  [0mnegative, and frankly until we understand one another better, uninformed personal judgements too.
  [0m
  [0mWe are divided to a harmful degree despite all of us having the same basic humanity.
  [0m
  [0mI urge you to talk, and I mean really talk with others very indifferent from you, who live differently than
  [0myou do and understand one another better.
  [0m
  [0mI do not know how we get our priorities in order as people otherwise. And without that, we rub the risk of our
  [0mfuture continuing to be an increasingly mixed bag for increasing numbers of us.
  [0m
  [0mFinally, consider this idea:
  [0m
  [0mWhen we make the discussion about what we oppose, it is not going to be about what we need, or want that is
  [0mgood.
  [0m
  [0mThink about trying to lead a team by only telling them what not to do. They will get somewhere, and it won't
  [0mbe anything anyone opposed either.
  [0m
  [0mWe all benefit from an explicit, public good. That means the basics are in order leaving people with free
  [0magency to get after better, or what they want.
  [0m
  [0mUnderstanding one another better will make that explicit, public good more clear.
  [0m
  [0mIt will improve our basic solidarity as people, reduce division.
  [0m
  [0mI submit one final idea:
  [0m
  [0mThere will not be a net public good we all benefit from and depend on, unless we make the discussion, body
  [0mpolitic, about it.
  [0m
  [0mAnd that is how I am playing it now, and have been for a while now.
  [0m
  [0mI want and need to be voting FOR good, not AGAINST bad, or evil.
  [0m
  [0mYou probably do too, and I encourage you to make more of the discussion about that explicit, public good and
  [0mdemand our leaders do the same things; namely, understand the people they need votes from better, and to apply
  [0mthat understanding to propose policy people can vote FOR, not just default to people voting AGAINST the very
  [0mworst.

  [0mWhile it’s true that the US government needs structural reform, the issue wasn’t anything the Constitution can
  [0mfix by nibbling around the edges. The issue is that the unified Republican elite, along with > 35% of the
  [0melectorate, is fundamentally lawless and anti-democratic, and will do anything it can to cheat its way into
  [0mpower. All three branches are implicated and have been for a while: Bush v Gore in 2000, the US Attorney
  [0mfirings, Shelby County in 2013, the refusal of the Senate to convict Trump in 2020, the disgusting
  [0manti-science politicization of coronavirus, and so on. The scale of Trump’s personal corruption is unique
  [0mamong Republican national figures, particularly in foreign policy. But the racist authoritarianism and
  [0mfundamental disrespect for elections is a defining creed of the party.
  [0m
  [0mOne of the more unpleasant truth about democracy is that it’s quite fragile. In any real sense, the US has
  [0monly been a democracy since 1965. When large segments of the population are ideologically opposed to
  [0mdemocratic governance - universal human rights, respecting fair elections, following the plain text of the
  [0mlaw, and so on - mechanisms by which democracy sustains itself begins to fail.
  [0m
  [0mOne possibility is to amend the constitution to change first-past-the-post voting in all local-to-federal
  [0melections, to let never-Trump types speak out without facing electoral suicide, and to divert
  [0mright-conservative attention away from a single “leader” figure. And obviously the electoral college needs to
  [0mgo.
  [0m
  [0mBut the fact that more than 65 million people voted for Trump at all speaks to a great sickness and nihilism
  [0min American culture. Trump himself might be put out to pasture. But Trumpism existed before he got here, and
  [0mit isn’t going anywhere.

  [0m"anyone but Trump" vote but you get enough undecided votes that there isn't any room for questioning the

  [0mpumping out fear about Covid. For the last few days there has been nothing to talk about while we waited for
  [0mthe recount yet no USA-centric Covid horror stories have appeared.
  [0m
  [0mWhy are they gone? Where did they go? There were waves of Covid stories for months on Reddit, HN, and other
  [0mmedia. Where did they go and more importantly where did the come from?

  [0mattempt to win elections".
  [0m
  [0mSo far it has been true.

  [0mto oust unstable governments and seat US-friendly, stable regimes. This approach failed in principle: Regime
  [0mchange itself did not lead to stability. But instead, led to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and ultimately, it
  [0mwas the protracted presence of US troops in those nations that provided stability. That stability was paid for
  [0mwith the lives of US soldiers put in harms way of militants from both within those nations and from outside
  [0mof them.

  [0mUnder Obama, two threats emerged: ISIS and an emboldened Iran. ISIS went from a 'JV Team', to controlling an
  [0marea the size of Pennsylvania, spanning Iraq and Syria[[32m3[0m]. Iran was granted an agreement to suspend
  [0mweapons-grade nuclear research until 2031 [[34m4[0m]. Iran may or may not be complying with the agreement, but it was
  [0mknown that they were causing instability throughout the Middle East, funding ISIS, Hezbolah, and planning and
  [0mfunding ambush attacks on US troops throughout the region[[36m5[0m].
  [0m
  [0mThis was the situation in January 2017.
  [0m
  [0mReviewing what the current administration has done since taking office, the coordinated and deliberate steps,
  [0mand the results, have been astonishing, given the intractable and largely unsuccessful efforts to stabilize
  [0mthe region over the last 50 years:
  [0m
  [0ma. Established 'energy independence' by modifying US regulations on production of oil, natural gas and coal.
  [0mThe US became a net exporter of energy, reducing the leverage that the Middle East states have over the US[[35m6[0m].
  [0m
  [0mb. Moved the US Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and recognize the Golan Heights as Sovereign Israel territory.
  [0mThis worked to gain trust from Israel, improving their willingness to participate in peace agreements. [[91m8[0m]
  [0m
  [0mc. Coordinated with Russia to eliminate ISIS. It was completely eradicated, including US Special Forces
  [0mkilling the leader and founder, Al-Baghdadi[[92m10[0m].
  [0m
  [0md. Withdrew from the Iran Nuclear accord, and renewed sanctions against Iran. The funds provided by the accord
  [0mlikely were used in part to fund their terror activities.
  [0m
  [0me. Killed General Soleimani, who was know to be the mastermind and source of funding for terrorism throughout
  [0mthe Middle East, directed not just at US, but other Arab States as well. [[97m7[0m] d. and e. illustrated to the Arab
  [0mStates that the US was willing to take decisive action to quell the regional threat that Iran posed.
  [0m
  [0mf. Withdrew troops from Syria, extricating the US from that war zone, after ISIS was defeated.
  [0m
  [0mg. Begin withdrawing troops from Iraq and Afghanistan. Most Arab countries want the US out so they can
  [0mself-govern again.
  [0m
  [0mh. With the above puzzle pieces in place, the administration rapidly concluded peace agreements between Israel
  [0mand three Arab states: United Arab Emirates, Bahrain [[93m9[0m] and later, Sudan. Other countries are said to be
  [0mjoining soon.
  [0m
  [0mi. Earned 2 Nobel peace prize nominations for the peace agreements (for 2021, winners will be announced next
  [0mSeptember).
  [0m
  [0mReviewing this timeline, and the magnitude of this achievement, it's hard to square the approach and its
  [0msuccess against the claims of ineptitude leveled.
